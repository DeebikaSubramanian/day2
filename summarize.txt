Node Js is programmed by Ryan Dahl

And I have summarized the following things from the video where Ryan Dahl talk about his regrets and challenge

Js ia dynamic language wher as dynamic language is the right tool for scientiic computing.

V8 y itself is a very good security sandbox.

Node could have had some nice securikty guarantees not available in any other language

Its unfortunate that there is a centralized (privately controlled even) repository for modules.

Dano is a secure typescript runtime on V8 working on the tag line.

Dano goals is to simply the module system
